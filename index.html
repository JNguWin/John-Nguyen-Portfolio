            A project idea that I want to work on is creating my first VR program or 
            create a well designed web page. For my VR program I hope to create an
            interactive environment where you are free to move around and interact 
            with objects, people, and animals. If I was to choose building a web page I 
            would like to create a home page like website that is comparable to a 
            professional web page for a major company.
