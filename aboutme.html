                    Welcome to my first webpage! Getting to know me a little bit I am a first-generation American. The first one in my 
                    family born in the U.S. and oldest of all my cousins. What got me here today was my love and interest in technology.
                    My first piece of technology that started it all would be the Nintendo Gamecube, it was such a fun system
                    to play with friends and family or just by yourself. Then technology started evolving and cellphones, desktops, and 
                    laptops became more known and available to the masses and my collection of gadgets started growing. 
                </p>

                    From there the internet became such a huge thing in peopes lives. Connecting people on social media, video games,
                    and different apps. In today's time almost everything in our daily lives are virtual now. All of these things
                    use some type of pragramming language to create and that sparked my interest in wanting to learn how these
                    things work and are created. I also believe tech will always continue to grow and be bigger 
                    in the future and knowing computer languages is a great skill to have and a great industry to get into. 
                    That is what got me here today pursuing a career in the Tech industry!

                    Some of my personal interest that I do on my free time is playing video games! I enjoy all types of games from 
                    single player RPG's to multiplayer games. I also love entertainment so I watch alot of anime and TV but I would
                    say anime would be one of my top genres to watch. I am also a gym rat, I spend a lot of time in the gym to stay 
                    in shape and maintain a healthy lifestyle!
